# Trijam #272 ([Bip Bap](https://finaldero.itch.io/bip-bap))

Game made for game jam [Trijam #272](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-272). The theme for the game was Bidirectional.

## About the game

Bip Bap is about a cube trying to reach the green space of the screen to gain points while avoiding falling blocks that get more difficult as the score increases. The only way of control is changing its direction to avoid the falling blocks but it has to be carefull not to backaway from the green space too much or else it will hit the red space and lose points.

## How to play :video_game:

The cube will reverse direction when it reaches the green or red space, the player can influence the direction with [SPACE] or [LEFT MOUSE BUTTON] changing it's direction to the opposite of where it was going to help it cross the gap between the two spaces and avoid falling blocks.
