The player automatically moves in a set direction and bounces off the green and red sides of the screen. Hitting the green side grants points while the red side decreases them. Hitting the falling blocks creates a game over.
The only controll that the player has is the change of the direction for the cube.

Bip Bap is about a cube trying to reach the green space of the screen to gain points while avoiding falling blocks that get more difficult as the score increases.

The green space will change location opposite of where it was once it has been reached leaving a red space that reduces points whenever it is reached.
The cube will reverse direction when it reaches the green or red space, the player can influence the direction with [SPACE] or [MOUSE BUTTON ] changing it's direction to the opposite of where it was going to help it cross the gap between the two spaces and avoid falling blocks.
